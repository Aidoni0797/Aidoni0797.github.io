There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love, remind me of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...

We could have had it all...
(you're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart...
(you're gonna wish you)...
Inside of your hand
(Never had met me)
And you played it...
(Tears are gonna fall)...
To the beat
(Rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

The scars of your love, remind you of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...

We could have had it all...
(you're gonna wish you never had met me)...
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart...
(you're gonna wish you)...
Inside of your hand
(Never had met me)
And you played it...
(Tears are gonna fall)...
To the beat
(Rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep.
You had my heart inside of your hand,
But you played it with your beating

Throw yourself through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
And pay me back in kind
You reap just what you sow...

You had my heart and soul
And you played it
To the beat
